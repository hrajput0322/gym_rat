# About
Hello everyone! 🚀 Exciting news—I've recently delved into the world of React and crafted a project that I'm thrilled to share with you: Gym Rat 🏋️‍♂️, the ultimate fitness resource! With over 1300 exercises at your fingertips, you can seamlessly search based on specific body parts, target muscle groups, required equipment, or directly by exercise name. Dive deeper into each exercise by clicking on its card to access step-by-step instructions for proper execution. But wait, there's more! 🌟 I've integrated related YouTube videos for a dynamic visual guide to your workout. I harnessed the power of the ExerciseDB and YouTube Search and Download APIs from Rapid API to bring this project to life. While this is just a foundational React project, I'm eagerly anticipating the journey ahead as I gain more experience in React development. 💻✨
